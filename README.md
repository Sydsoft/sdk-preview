# SDK Preview
Tilt Five utilizes a system composed of glasses, a special game board with a  retroreflective surface, and a motion-tracked wand controller. To use this system with a Unity project, we provide a plugin to act as a bridge between the Tilt Five hardware and Unity.

The Tilt Five SDK Preview contains the Unity plugin, which exposes the Glasses, Game Board, and Tilt Five Manager.
The purpose of the SDK Preview is to let interested developers start familiarizing themselves with the Tilt Five SDK's Unity plugin while we are working on getting the hardware manufactured and shipped.

# Getting Started
To start developing with the Tilt Five SDK Preview, either:
1. Copy the source files under `sdk-preview/sdk/unity/unity_package` into a new folder within your Unity project's Assets folder.

or
1. Download the latest release and extract its contents.
  1. From the extracted folder, import `TiltFivePlugin-Preview.unitypackage` into your Unity project (Unity 2018.4 LTS or newer).

Be sure to check out the `Hello Tilt Five` example Unity project under `sdk-examples` for an example of how to set up a scene using the SDK Preview. For further information, see `Tilt Five Unity Preview Development Setup.pdf`

# Say hi!
If you're a developer working on a project using the SDK Preview, we'd love to hear about it and answer your questions.
